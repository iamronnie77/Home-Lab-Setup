# Home-Lab-Setup

In this lab, we are going to download and install Oracle VirtualBox which is what will be used to run the Virtual Machines (VM) on.
After that's been installed, we are going to download a windows 10 iso and a server 2019 iso that we're going to use to
install the two operating systems on two separate Virtual Machines (VM).
